# DunnyDash – Public Restroom Data & Mapping Resources

DunnyDash is a location-based project focused on improving access to **public restroom data** for travellers, families, drivers, and anyone who needs reliable amenity info on the go.

This repository is a **developer- and civic-tech–friendly companion** to the live DunnyDash sites.  
It documents the problem space, patterns, and integration ideas for using restroom and amenity data in your own projects.

## 🚻 Why Restroom Data Matters

Most major mapping platforms only partially cover public restrooms. Common issues include:

- Missing or incorrect locations  
- No details about accessibility or baby-change facilities  
- No indication of opening hours or seasonal closures  
- Poor coverage in **regional**, **remote**, and **parkland** areas  

DunnyDash exists to explore how a **focused, amenity-first dataset** can improve:

- Travel planning  
- Tourism experience  
- Disability and accessibility support  
- Long-distance driving and freight work  
- Outdoor recreation (camping, hiking, fishing, etc.)

## 🧩 Use Cases

Some ways developers, councils, and community groups might use DunnyDash-style data:

- Embedding restroom maps into **local council websites**
- Adding amenity layers into **tourism portals** or **visitor guides**
- Assisting route planning for **cyclists, hikers, and road-trippers**
- Supporting **accessibility mapping** for people with medical conditions
- Creating **education resources** around infrastructure and urban planning
